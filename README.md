## 📌 Project Abstract

Cricksy is a cloud-native web application that streamlines the process of discovering, booking, and managing cricket courts (cricksals). The platform addresses the inefficiencies of manual court booking by providing a scalable, real-time, and user-friendly solution. Leveraging modern cloud technologies, Cricksy ensures high availability, scalability, and seamless collaboration among users, owners, and administrators.

---

## ⛳ Problem Statements

- **Challenge:** Manual booking of cricket courts is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks transparency for both users and owners.
- **Context:** In the era of cloud computing, digital transformation of sports facility management is essential for efficiency and accessibility.
- **Impact:** Automating and digitizing the booking process improves user experience, optimizes resource utilization, and enables data-driven management for owners and admins.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a web application for cricket court booking using cloud services.
- Implement scalable backend APIs and real-time data updates.
- Integrate secure user authentication and role-based access control.
- Enable admin dashboard functionalities for managing courts, bookings, and users.

## 🚀 Implementation Highlights

- **Core Features:** Role-based dashboards, real-time booking, review system, image uploads, admin management.
- **Challenges:** Ensuring data consistency for bookings, secure file uploads, and role-based access control.
- **Solutions:** Used JWT for authentication, Multer for secure uploads, and Mongoose for schema validation.
- **Key Decisions:** Chose serverless image storage (S3) for scalability; used Docker for consistent deployment.

---

## 🌌 Testing & Validation

- **Integration Testing:** Postman for API endpoints.
- **Security Testing:** JWT validation, input sanitization, and role-based access checks.

---

## 📊 Results & Performance

- **Response Time:** < 200ms for most API endpoints under normal load.
- **Scalability:** Horizontally scalable via Docker containers and cloud hosting.
- **Uptime:** 99.9% (cloud-hosted, monitored)
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go cloud resources, minimal idle costs.
